              <h2>Employment</h2>
              <p>From 2015 until now, I've been running Ast Clear Text, offering services from coaching to proofreading for scholarly texts in English. </p>
              <p>Between 2013 and 2016, I was a language tutor at Uppsala University’s <a href="http://www.sprakverkstaden.uu.se/?languageId=1">Language Workshop</a> (<a href="http://www.sprakverkstaden.uu.se">Språkverkstaden</a>).</p>

              <h2>Education</h2>
              <p>From 2008 to 2010, I was involved in a post-doctoral project at Uppsala, using metagenomics and next-generation DNA sequencing to investigate bacterial diversity in Swedish lakes.</p>
              <p>Before that, I was a research fellow at the University of Michigan (2002-2007); my research used DNA to study the ecology and evolutionary relationships of luminous marine bacteria symbiotic with fishes and squids. I also received my Masters and Ph.D. from Michigan, where my research was about the evolutionary relationships among turtles, certain types of lizards, and between lizards and snakes.</p>
              <p>I received my B.S. from the University of Chicago, where I was a biology major, honor student, and soccer player.</p>

              <h2>Here's what I bring to the table</h2>
              <p class="decorator">Years of practical writing experience</p>
              <p class="indented">I have myself written and published peer-reviewed publications, and I understand that expressing abstract ideas can be very difficult.</p>

              <p class="decorator">Years of relevant work experience</p>
              <p class="indented">I have myself been a university researcher, and I know firsthand the stress of writing a thesis, and the pressures to get grants and publications. </p>

              <p class="decorator">A convenient location</p>
              <p class="indented">I live in Uppsala, and am happy to meet face-to-face to discuss your text.</p>

              <p class="decorator">I like reading research and helping people clarify their ideas.</p>
              <p class="indented">I have always enjoyed reading about a variety of topics and subjects. When I read new research, I try to understand it. I will find your text interesting, and I will enjoy helping you get it out into the world.</p>

              <p class="decorator">I appreciate diversity.</p>
              <p class="indented">I have worked with people from many different countries with many different first languages. Having tried to do it myself, I am especially sympathetic to the difficulties of writing academic texts in a foreign language.</p>

              <p class="decorator">I understand academia and its ways. </p>
              <p class="indented">I speak geek.</p>
